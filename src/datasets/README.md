# Pyrocko Dataset Submodule

The `pyrocko.dataset` submodule gives access to several helpful geological and geophysical datasets:

* The `pyrocko.dataset.crust2x2` gives an interface to use CRUST2.0 model by Laske, Masters and Reif.
* The `pyrocko.dataset.crustdb` accesses the Global Crustal Database (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/crust) for statistical analysis of empirical velocity profiles.
* The `pyrocko.dataset.gshhg` offers an interface to the Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolutions Geography Database (GSHHG; http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/gshhg/).
* The `pyrocko.dataset.tectonics` module consists of the tectonic datasets
  * `pyrocko.dataset.PeterBird2002` An updated digital model of plate boundaries. (Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 4.3, 2003)
  * `pyrocko.dataset.GSRM1` An integrated global model of present-day plate motions and plate boundary deformation (Kreemer, C., W.E. Holt, and A.J. Haines, 2003)
