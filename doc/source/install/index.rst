Installation
============

Pyrocko can be installed on every operating system where its prerequisites are
available. If you are using Anaconda, prebuild packages are available (see :doc:`packages/anaconda`), also source packages for PIP are available :doc:`packages/pip`.

If you do not want to use package managers like Anaconda or PIP to install Pyrocko, try to follow the instructions in :doc:`system/index`. For additional information, refer to :doc:`details`. If you run into problems during installation, `please let us know <https://github.com/pyrocko/pyrocko/issues>`_ or on the support forum `hive.pyrocko.org <https://hive.pyrocko.org/signup_user_complete/?id=9edryhxeptdbmxrecbwy3zg49y>`_.
