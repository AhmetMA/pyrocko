Package managers installations
------------------------------

We have pre-build packages ready for Anaconda3 running on Linux64 and OSX, if you want to keep using Anaconda2 you have to build Pyrocko from scratch. For the package manager ``pip`` we have source packages ready, meaning Pyrocko is build on your system during the installation:
